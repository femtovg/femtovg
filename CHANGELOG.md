# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

- Fixed `stroke_text()` line widths under a scaled canvas transform. The width
  crossed into the rasterizer's space inconsistently per regime: baked-atlas
  glyphs never scaled it, while path-fallback glyphs scaled it twice, so the
  drawn width changed law with the zoom, the font size, and even the paint
  flavor. All user-space text quantities now cross through the baked scale at
  one place, and a zoom-invariance test suite holds the regime seams.
- Added elliptical radial gradients, matching CSS's `radial-gradient(ellipse ...)`.
  New `Paint` constructors `elliptical_gradient()` and `elliptical_gradient_stops()`
  take separate inner/outer radii per axis. `PaintFlavor::RadialGradient`'s
  `in_radius` and `out_radius` fields changed from `f32` to `(f32, f32)` to hold the
  per-axis radii; `Paint::radial_gradient()` and `radial_gradient_stops()` keep their
  existing scalar-radius signatures unchanged.
- Fixed the paragraph base direction of shaped text: it now follows the first
  strong character (UAX #9 rules P2/P3) instead of being pinned
  left-to-right. An Arabic or Hebrew sentence is treated as a right-to-left
  paragraph, so its neutral punctuation sits at the visual left end, embedded
  left-to-right words order correctly between their RTL neighbors, and
  strong-less text keeps the LTR default. The shaped-word cache now also keys
  on the run direction, so direction-neutral words (digits, brackets) shaped
  in one direction are no longer replayed in the other - previously a
  mirrored bracket could render unmirrored in RTL text if the same word had
  been shaped in LTR text first.

- Fixed `Canvas::measure_font()` scaling its result by the canvas transform's
  internal glyph-rasterization scale and the DPI factor. It now reports
  user-space metrics that depend only on the paint's font size, matching
  `measure_text()`, `TextContext::measure_font()` and the coordinate space
  `fill_text()` consumes. Previously, metrics read from a zoomed canvas came
  back inflated - for example sub/superscript runs sized via
  `subscript_size()` grew with the zoom level instead of staying proportional
  to the run's font size.
- Added two-point radial gradients, the general Canvas
  `createRadialGradient(x0, y0, r0, x1, y1, r1)` form where the start and end
  circles may have different centres. New `Paint` constructors
  `two_point_radial_gradient()` and `two_point_radial_gradient_stops()`.
  Concentric radials keep using the existing cheaper path.
- Added a transform on gradient paints, the role SVG's `gradientTransform`
  plays. New `Paint` methods `set_gradient_transform()` and
  `with_gradient_transform()`. It applies to the gradient ahead of the canvas
  transform, so the shape does not follow it, which is what expresses a gradient
  whose axes are scaled differently: an elliptical radial gradient could not be
  described by the circle and radius parameters alone.

- Fixed `Path::rounded_rect()` and `rounded_rect_varying()` flattening corners
  into ellipses when a radius did not fit. Radii that overlap along a side are
  now reduced by one common factor, as CSS Backgrounds and Borders Level 3 and
  the Canvas `roundRect()` algorithm both specify, so corners keep their shape:
  a radius larger than half the height now gives a fully rounded end rather than
  a squashed one. A corner may also use a whole side when the corner next to it
  is square, which the previous clamp cut in half. Negative and NaN radii leave
  the corner square instead of bulging it outwards or emitting NaN coordinates,
  and an infinite radius rounds as far as the box allows. This changes rendering
  for shapes whose radii did not fit.
- Fixed the WGPU renderer aborting instead of reporting an error when
  `update_image()` is given a copy that reaches past the destination image, or a
  source in a different pixel format. Both now return
  `ErrorKind::ImageUpdateOutOfBounds` and
  `ErrorKind::ImageUpdateWithDifferentFormat`, as the OpenGL and `Void`
  renderers already did. The shared check is exposed as
  `ImageSource::check_update()` for out-of-tree renderers, and reports rather
  than overflows for an origin close to `usize::MAX`.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-07-20

- Added Canvas 2D drop shadows for fills, strokes and text. New `Canvas` methods
  `set_shadow_color()`, `set_shadow_blur()` and `set_shadow_offset()`. Shadows
  cost a per-draw offscreen blur; a transparent shadow color restores the
  zero-overhead path. Thanks @matthargett
- Added rounded scissor support. New `Canvas` methods `rounded_scissor()` and
  `intersect_rounded_scissor()` take a corner radius; intersections that can't
  be represented exactly fall back to rectangular scissoring. Thanks
  @matthargett
- Added a start angle to conic gradients for Canvas conformance. New `Paint`
  constructors `conic_gradient()`, `conic_gradient_with_angle()` and
  `conic_gradient_stops_with_angle()`. Previously serialized paints still
  deserialize, defaulting to the prior no-rotation behavior. Thanks
  @matthargett
- Added an `ImageSource::HtmlCanvasElement` variant, letting callers hand over a
  source already rasterized at the wanted size. This avoids a wgpu panic when
  enlarging an `HtmlImageElement` for hidpi output. Thanks @yebei199
- Gradients are dithered to reduce banding. Thanks @matthargett
- Bumped WGPU renderer to use WGPU 30.x
- Fixed text layout to preserve the fractional baseline (#281). Thanks
  @matthargett
- Fixed scaled-atlas text positioning to use the true scale rather than the
  quantized one. Thanks @matthargett

## [0.25.1] - 2026-05-29

- Added dashed stroke support. New `Paint` methods `set_line_dash()` /
  `line_dash()` / `with_line_dash()` and `set_line_dash_offset()` /
  `line_dash_offset()` / `with_line_dash_offset()`, plus `Path::dashed()` to
  produce a dashed copy of a path.
- Render text crisply under uniform-scale transforms: glyphs drawn with a
  uniform scale combined with a translation are now rasterized into the atlas
  at the on-screen size (for solid color fills) instead of falling back to
  path rendering.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-05-13

- Bumped WGPU renderer to use WGPU 29.x. Thanks @matthargett

## [0.24.0] - 2026-05-05

- WGPU: Fixed `HtmlImageElement` upload path.
- Added external texture support. New `Canvas::create_image_from_external_texture()`
  for importing platform-specific external textures (e.g. EGL/OES external
  textures in OpenGL, external texture views in WGPU).

## [0.23.2] - 2026-04-13

- Fall back to path rendering for glyphs under non-translation transforms.

## [0.23.1] - 2026-03-31

- Fix variable font glyph caching returning wrong variation instance when
  using swash. Stale normalized coordinates in swash's ScaleContext could
  cause glyphs from a previous variation (e.g. bold) to appear for
  subsequent default-instance renders.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-03-30

- Added variable font support. New methods on `Paint`: `set_font_weight()`,
  `set_font_italic()`, `set_font_slant()`, and generic `set_font_variation()`
  with corresponding getters, `with_` builders, and `clear_` methods.
- Added named font weight constants on `Paint` (`FONT_WEIGHT_THIN` through
  `FONT_WEIGHT_BLACK`).
- Added `Canvas::font_variation_axes()` to query available variation axes
  for variable fonts, and new `VariationAxisInfo` public type.
- **Breaking:** `Canvas::fill_glyph_run()` and `Canvas::stroke_glyph_run()`
  now take an additional `normalized_coords: &[i16]` parameter for variable
  font axis positions. Pass `&[]` for default behavior.
- Replaced bundled Roboto with Roboto Flex for examples and added slant
  support with italic fallback.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-03-26

- WGPU: Changed API from `flush_to_surface()` to `flush_to_output()` and
  accept a type that can be converted to a new WGPURenderOutput struct,
  making it possible to render into texture views.
- WGPU: Simplified CommandBuffer to be an Option<>, so that it can be
  passed to queue's `submit()` without additional wrapping.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-03-23

 - Fixed rendering of text strokes with large font sizes.

## [0.9.0] - 2024-02-27

## [0.8.0] - 2023-11-02

 - Re-release 0.7.2 with major version bump. 0.7.2 was yanked because
   glow is a re-exported public dependency, that was bumped.

## [0.7.2] - 2023-11-02

 - Bump internal dependencies.

## [0.7.1] - 2023-06-14

- Fix performance regression when drawing unclipped image path fills.

### Changed

 - Path drawing functions now take a `&Path` instead of a `&mut Path` and use interior mutability
   for caching.

## [0.6.0] - 2023-02-06

### Changed

 - Changed `linear_gradient_stops` and `radial_gradient_stops` to take an `IntoIterator`
   instead of a slice slice for the color stops.

## [0.5.0] - 2023-02-06

### Added

 - added a new `Size` struct, having a `width` and a `height`.
 - added `size` function to `Image` type, which returns both, `width` and `height` as a `Size`

### Changed

 - Renamed `draw_glyph_cmds` to `draw_glyph_commands`.
 - Renamed `DrawCmd` to `DrawCommand`.
 - `set_transform` takes a value of type `Transform2D` now instead of a parameter list.
 - `dimensions` of `ImageSource` returns a new `Size` type now.

## [0.4.0] - 2023-01-27

### Added

 - `OpenGl::new_from_function_cstr` to create the renderer from a GL loading function that
   takes an `&std::ffi::CStr`.

### Fixed

 - Fixed erroneously multiply applied global alpha when mixing color glyphs with regular glyphs.

 - `new_from_glutin_context` can now be used with headless contexts.
 - All const-safe `Color` constructors are now const.
 - `Canvas`'s text layout methods no longer require a mutable reference.
 - Removed the copy trait from `Paint` to avoid accidental copies.
 - `Paint` is always supplied by reference now.
 - `TextContext`'s `resize_shaping_run_cache` and `resize_shaped_words_cache` functions now take a
   `std::num::NonZeroUsize` for the capacity value.
 - As part of the glutin update, `OpenGL::new_from_glutin_context` was renamed to `new_from_glutin_display` and takes a glutin display now.
 - Removed `glutin` from the default features.

## [0.3.7] - 2022-10-24

### Fixed

 - Fix build with latest rustybuzz release after 0.5.2 breakage. 0.5.3 doesn't
   re-export the ttf_parser module anymore.

## [0.3.6] - 2022-10-23

### Fixed

 - Fix build with latest rustybuzz release.

## [0.3.5] - 2022-05-23

### Changed

 - Optimized the OpenGL renderer to perform better on older GPUs by splitting the large fragment shader
   into smaller programs.

## [0.3.4] - 2022-04-07

### Added

 - Added support for importing backend-specific textures into the rendering of a scene with `Canvas::create_image_from_native_texture`.
 - Added functions to `TextContext` to configure the text shaping caches: `resize_shaping_run_cache` and `resize_shaped_words_cache`.

### Changed

 - Added optimized rendering code path for the common case of filling a rectangular path with an image and anti-aliasing
   on the paint disabled.

### Fixed

 - Fixed line breaking to permit a break in the middle of a word if it is the first word in the paragraph
   and it doesn't fit otherwise.

## [0.3.3] - 2022-02-21

### Changed

 - Bumped rustybuzz and ttf-parser dependencies.

## [0.3.2] - 2022-02-09

### Fixed

 - Correctly detect when WebGL is disabled in a web browser in the `renderer::OpenGL::new_from_html_canvas` function.

## [0.3.1] - 2022-02-08

### Fixed

 - Don't require default features of glutin. We don't need any and this way other users of glutin
   have the ability to opt out.

## [0.3.0] - 2022-02-04

### Changed

 - **Breaking:** The dependency to the `image` crate was bumped from `0.23` to `0.24`.
   Since the types of this crate are used in public femtovg API, users need to upgrade
   their dependency to the `image` crate as well.
 - **Breaking**: Removed deprecated `renderer::OpenGL::new` function. Use `renderer::OpenGl::new_from_function`
   or `renderer::OpenGl::new_from_glutin_context`.

### Added

 - Use `Paint::image_tint` to create an image paint that not only applies an alpha but an entire color (tint).

### Fixed

 - Improved performance of `fill_path` and `stroke_path`
