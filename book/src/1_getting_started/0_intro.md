# Getting Started

Let's start with a simple program â€“ we'll create a window and paint a simple shape on it!

If you don't have one already, make a new crate named `hello_femtovg`:

```commandline
cargo new hello_femtovg
```

> Unless you have much big brain, it is highly recommended that you [learn Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html) first, then come back here.
